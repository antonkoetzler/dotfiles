# My (Arch) Linux setup

## Want to try it out?

### **NOTE: This is my setup. Run at your own risk!**

Run `bash install_dependencies.sh`.

## Known problems and fixes

- Brave is super slow when focused: Go to `brave://flags` and set `Preferred Ozone platform` to `Wayland`.

## TODO

- Add the power daemon profiles found in the default wayland config so i can have low power mode on my laptop.
